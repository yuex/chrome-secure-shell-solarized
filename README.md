# google chrome secure shell solarized color scheme

Basicly, it's configuration is similar with Terminator. But I did'nt
locate the exact position of its configuration files. So I wrote a
config file. Althougle it won't config the secure shell itself, you
can do some copy-and-paste work, to make secure shell have a
solarized color scheme. This is not a perfect solutioin. But more
or less it eases some burden
