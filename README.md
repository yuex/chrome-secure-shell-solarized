# Chrome Secure Shell Solarized

Basicly, it's configuration is similar with Terminator. But I did'nt
locate the exact position of its configuration files. So I wrote a
config file. Althougle it won't config the secure shell itself, you
can do some copy-and-paste work, to make secure shell have a
solarized color scheme. This is not a perfect solutioin. But more
or less it eases some burden

# Usage

1. open a new tab in chrome and switch to app page
2. right-click on the secure shell icon
3. left-click options
4. enter the values needed. check config file for details
5. open a new connection in secure shell, choose the profile u just edited/created
